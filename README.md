# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Author: Ibrahim Yucel
The following code is intended to consolidate and organize raw data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones", which itself is an aggregation of motion (e.g. accelerometer and gyroscope) data from various individuals using the Samsung Galaxy S line of smartphones.  
The code imports the relevant data files (in *.txt file format) from the given working directory, changes variable names as needed and combines the various data sets as required to create one usable data table with descriptive variable names and only one observation per row.  

The unaltered source data for this set is available from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

For further information on the data set itself, see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The only modification this code requires from you is to set the appropriate working directory (referring to the folder where the raw UCI HAR Dataset is located) - You will need to set this directory in line 6 of the code. 

Also see the CodeBook.MD file for detailed description of each variable.
